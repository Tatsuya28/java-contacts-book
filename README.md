# ContactsBook

Hello there, here is my first project since ages in java. I am rusty.

## TODO features

[ x ] **Contact addition:** Enable user to add a contact

[  ] **Contact Search:** Implement a search feature allowing users to quickly find a contact by name.

[  ] **Contact Modification and Deletion:** Add features enabling users to modify the information of an existing contact
or delete it.

[  ] **Multiple Phone Number Management:** Allow users to add multiple phone numbers for the same contact.

[  ] **Automatic File Saving on Exit:** Modify your program to automatically save contacts to a file when the user exits
the application.

[  ] **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** If you are comfortable with graphical interfaces, consider creating a graphical
user interface to make the phone directory more user-friendly.

[  ] **Contact Sorting:** Add sorting features to organize contacts by name, first name, or phone number.

[  ] **User Input Validation:** Ensure that user inputs are valid and handle errors appropriately.

[  ] **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for your classes to ensure that your code works correctly and to facilitate
maintenance.

[  ] **Save in a More User-Friendly Format:** Consider storing contacts in a more structured file format (e.g., JSON) to
facilitate reading and maintenance.

[  ] **Exception Handling:** Improve exception handling in your code to make the application more robust.

[  ] **Documentation:** Add comments to your code to explain complex or non-obvious logic. You could also generate
automated documentation using tools like Javadoc.
